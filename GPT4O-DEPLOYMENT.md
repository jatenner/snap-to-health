# GPT-4o Vision Implementation

## Overview
This update enforces GPT-4o Vision as the default method for meal image analysis in Snap2Health, with OCR as a fallback mechanism. The implementation prioritizes high-quality image analysis while ensuring reliability through graceful degradation.

## Key Changes

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Created centralized environment utilities in `src/lib/env.ts`
- Enforced type safety for environment variables
- Added validation and logging for environment configuration

### 2. API Route Enhancement
- Refactored `src/app/api/analyzeImage/route.ts` to prioritize GPT-4o Vision
- Implemented proper fallback to OCR when GPT-4o fails
- Added detailed metadata about which analysis method was used
- Improved error handling and reporting

### 3. Health Monitoring
- Added `/api/health` endpoint to verify configuration
- Created verification scripts to validate setup
- Enhanced error logging with source tracking

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are set:
```
USE_GPT4_VISION=true
USE_OCR_EXTRACTION=true
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
To deploy to Vercel with the correct configuration:

1. Update environment variables:
   ```
   node src/scripts/update-vercel-env.js
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Verify the deployment:
   ```
   node src/scripts/verify-vision-ocr.js https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
   ```

### 3. Verification
You should see the following confirmation message if everything is working correctly:
```
✅ GPT-4o meal analysis active
The system is properly configured to use GPT-4o Vision for meal analysis with OCR as fallback.
```

## Fallback Behavior
1. If GPT-4o Vision fails (API error, timeout, etc.), the system will automatically fall back to OCR-based analysis
2. If OCR is disabled or also fails, a comprehensive error message will be returned
3. All analyses include metadata indicating which method was used and any fallback information

## Troubleshooting
- Check the health endpoint at `/api/health` to verify configuration
- Ensure your OpenAI API key has access to the GPT-4o model
- Set `USE_OCR_EXTRACTION=true` to enable fallback
- Check logs for detailed error messages with the format `[requestId] ❌ Error: ...`
