# Snap to Health - Build Fixes

## Issues Resolved

The following build issues have been fixed to ensure successful deployment:

### 1. Missing Dependencies

Installed required dependencies that were causing build failures:

- `react-hot-toast` - Required for toast notifications in the upload flow
- `node-cache` - Required for API caching in the image analysis route
- `tesseract.js` - OCR functionality for text extraction from images
- `@tailwindcss/forms` - Required by the TailwindCSS configuration
- `encoding` - Required by node-fetch (used by OpenAI SDK)
- `null-loader` (dev dependency) - Used to handle problematic undici modules

### 2. Firebase SDK Issues

The Firebase SDK was causing build failures due to its use of private class fields in the undici library. We resolved this by:

1. Adding `transpilePackages: ['@firebase/auth', '@firebase/storage', 'firebase']` to Next.js config
2. Adding a webpack rule to exclude problematic undici files using null-loader:

```js
config.module.rules.push({
  test: /undici\/lib\/web\/fetch\/util\.js$/,
  use: 'null-loader',
  include: [
    /node_modules\/@firebase\/storage\/node_modules\/undici/,
    /node_modules\/firebase\/node_modules\/undici/
  ]
});
```

### 3. Storage API Route Optimization

Refactored the Firebase storage API route to address compatibility issues:

1. Changed from static imports to dynamic imports of Firebase modules
2. Specified Node.js runtime instead of Edge runtime to avoid private class fields issues
3. Improved error handling and structure

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Local Build Testing**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   Verify that the build completes without errors.

2. **Deployment to Vercel**
   ```
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```
   This will deploy the latest changes to the production environment.

## Environment Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables are properly set in Vercel:
- All Firebase configuration variables
- OpenAI API key
- Nutritionix API credentials
- Feature flags (USE_OCR_EXTRACTION=true, etc.)

## Next Steps

After deployment, validate the following functionality:
1. Image upload and analysis flow
2. Meal saving to Firebase
3. User authentication
4. Nutritional analysis display
