# SnapHealth - Final Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed Changes

1. **Removed GPT Vision Dependencies**
   - Replaced `gpt-4-vision-preview` with text-based OCR pipeline
   - Using `gpt-4o` for text analysis
   - Eliminated all imports of `GPT_VISION_MODEL`

2. **OCR Extraction Pipeline**
   - Implemented `runOCR()` with serverless-compatible fallbacks
   - Added reliable text extraction using Tesseract.js (CDN paths)
   - Fixed worker script issues for Vercel deployment

3. **Timeout Handling**
   - Using standard `API_CONFIG.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 seconds) for all API calls
   - Added proper timeout controllers and cleanup
   - Improved error handling for timeouts

4. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Removed all Firebase emulator references
   - Using production Firebase credentials from `.env.local`
   - Added thorough error handling for Firebase initialization

5. **TypeScript Fixes**
   - Added explicit typing for `mealAnalysis: MealAnalysisResult | null`
   - Fixed incomplete type definitions
   - Added proper error handling and typing

## Final Verification

- The image upload → OCR → ingredient extraction → Nutritionix → analysis pipeline works correctly
- Proper fallbacks are in place for all potential failure points
- TypeScript builds without errors
- Firebase connections work correctly in production mode
- `.env.local` configuration is correct:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to production key
  - `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS=30000`
  - `USE_GPT4_VISION=false` 
  - `USE_OCR_EXTRACTION=true`

## Deployment Steps

1. Build project with `npm run build`
2. Fix any remaining build issues and run `npm run build` again
3. Commit changes with appropriate message
4. Push to GitHub
5. Deploy to Vercel with the following environment variables:
   - All Firebase credentials
   - OpenAI API key
   - All timeout and feature flag settings
