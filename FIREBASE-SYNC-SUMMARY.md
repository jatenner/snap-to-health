# Firebase Environment Variables Sync Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the process of syncing Firebase environment variables between the local development environment and Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made

1. **Environment Files Comparison**
   - Compared Firebase variables in `.env.local` and `.env.local.firebase`
   - Confirmed that the local files are already in sync with matching API keys and other configuration

2. **Vercel Environment Updates**
   - Created scripts to automate the process of syncing environment variables to Vercel
   - Updated the following Firebase variables in Vercel:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` (Updated to `AIzaSyDQzBnFnrPJbxi2-hFmuQd2bDVRo2ikHiU`)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`
     - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
     - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID`
     - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`

3. **Scripts Created**
   - `scripts/sync-firebase-env.js`: Compares Firebase variables between `.env.local` and `.env.local.firebase`
   - `scripts/update-vercel-firebase.js`: Generates commands for updating Vercel with variables from `.env.local`
   - `scripts/sync-firebase-to-vercel.js`: Automates the process of syncing all Firebase variables from `.env.local` to Vercel

## Verification

- All Firebase environment variables from `.env.local` are now synced to Vercel
- The application has been deployed to production with updated Firebase configuration

## Future Recommendations

1. **Automated Sync**
   - Consider integrating the sync script into CI/CD pipeline for automatic syncing during deployment

2. **Environment Validation**
   - Add validation checks to ensure Firebase configuration is correct before deployment

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain documentation of the Firebase project configuration and any changes made

## Deployment URL

The application has been deployed to:
https://snap-to-health-obbd0bmea-jonah-tenner-s-projects.vercel.app
