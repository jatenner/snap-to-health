# Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Replaced GPT Vision with OCR-based Analysis

- Updated `src/lib/constants.ts` to use `gpt-4o` as the default model
- Added `gpt-4` to the fallback models list
- Removed any lingering references to `gpt-4-vision-preview`
- Ensured OCR text extraction is set to `true` in feature flags

### 2. Timeout Configuration

- Ensured consistent timeout configuration using `API_CONFIG.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 seconds)
- Imported the API_CONFIG in analyzeMealTextOnly.ts for consistent timeout handling

### 3. Build Process Fixes

- Cleaned build cache to resolve worker script errors
- Ensured type definitions for MealAnalysisResult are properly imported and used
- Removed .next directory to ensure clean builds

### 4. Firebase Configuration

- Verified Firebase configuration is set to use production environment
- Confirmed no emulator configurations are present in the codebase

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Push changes to the `deploy/ocr-analysis-v1` branch
   - Connect to Vercel and select the repository
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Vercel

2. **Environment Variables**
   - OPENAI_API_KEY: The OpenAI API key with access to gpt-4o
   - FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64: Base64-encoded Firebase private key
   - Other Firebase and Nutritionix configuration variables

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Test the OCR-based meal analysis functionality
   - Verify timeout handling works correctly
   - Ensure Firebase connections are working with the production Firestore

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing additional error handling for OCR-based analysis
- Add retry mechanisms for Nutritionix API calls
- Enhance feedback based on OCR confidence levels
