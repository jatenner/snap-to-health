# API Verification Results

## Environment Setup
- Successfully created `.env.local` with the provided API keys
- Application loaded the environment variables correctly

## API Test Results
- **OpenAI API**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - API key is valid
  - Can successfully make API calls to OpenAI

- **Nutritionix API**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - API credentials are valid
  - Can successfully retrieve nutrition data

## Next Steps
The application is now correctly configured to:
1. Use GPT-4 Vision to analyze meal photos
2. Retrieve detailed nutrition information from Nutritionix
3. Provide health-goal-specific feedback

The `/api/analyzeImage` endpoint is ready to process meal photos and health goals as designed.

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Add caching for Nutritionix API calls to reduce API usage
- Implement more detailed error handling for failed API requests
- Add rate limiting to prevent excessive API calls
