# SnapHealth Patch - Fixes for Image Analysis and Upload Flow\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. API Endpoint Improvements (src/app/api/analyzeImage/route.ts):\n- Added comprehensive timing metrics with console.time/timeEnd for all major operations\n- Implemented proper AbortController with 45s timeout for OpenAI Vision API calls\n- Updated Nutritionix API calls to use Promise.allSettled with a 10s global timeout\n- Added explicit success/error flags in all API responses (success: true/false)\n- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging in all catch blocks\n- Gracefully handle partial nutrition data when some ingredients can't be processed\n\n### 2. Frontend Upload Page Fixes (src/app/upload/page.tsx):\n- Added response validation to check for success: false before processing data\n- Improved error message extraction from various response formats\n- Added specialized error handling for different error types (timeouts, rate limits, etc.)\n- Enhanced user feedback with more specific error toast messages\n- Properly reset UI state when errors occur\n\n### 3. Meal Analysis Page Improvements (src/app/meal-analysis/page.tsx):\n- Added validation of analysis data structure before rendering\n- Implemented graceful error handling for corrupted sessionStorage data\n- Added user-friendly error UI when analysis fails\n- Added safe fallbacks for all required data fields\n- Added validation checks for nutrient arrays to prevent runtime errors\n\n## Key Benefits:\n- Eliminates 504 Gateway Timeout errors by properly managing API timeouts\n- Prevents frontend crashes by validating data before rendering\n- Provides users with clear error messages when issues occur\n- Allows partial success with nutrition data when some API calls fail\n- Significantly improves error logging for debugging\n\nThese changes should resolve the critical issues affecting the SnapHealth image upload and analysis workflow.
