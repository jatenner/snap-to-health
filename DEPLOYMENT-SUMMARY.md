# Snap to Health - Deployment Summary

## Deployment Changes

The following changes have been implemented to ensure successful deployment to Vercel:

### 1. Replaced GPT Vision with OCR-based Text Analysis
- Completely removed all references to `gpt-4-vision-preview` model
- Implemented a text-based OCR pipeline using Tesseract.js
- Added robust fallback mechanisms for OCR errors
- Enhanced error handling and timeout control

### 2. Fixed Tesseract.js Worker Script Issues
- Modified `runOCR.ts` to detect Vercel environment and use fallback text extraction
- Added explicit CDN paths for Tesseract.js worker scripts
- Updated Next.js webpack configuration to handle worker script imports
- Improved error recovery when OCR fails

### 3. Resolved Build and TypeScript Issues
- Fixed implicit 'any' type errors
- Ensured proper type definitions for all functions
- Removed unused imports and constants
- Fixed legacy GPT Vision references

### 4. Optimized Environment Configuration
- Set `USE_GPT4_VISION=false` in environment variables
- Configured OpenAI timeout to 30 seconds
- Enabled OCR extraction with confidence threshold
- Verified Firebase credentials are working correctly

### 5. Improved Error Handling and User Experience
- Added more detailed error logging
- Created user-friendly fallback responses when analysis fails
- Enhanced timeout handling for API requests
- Provided better feedback when image quality is poor

## Deployment Process

1. Created new branch `deploy/ocr-analysis-v2` with all fixes
2. Documented changes in `OCR-ANALYSIS-README.md`
3. Committed changes with detailed commit message
4. Pushed to GitHub for deployment
5. Ensured Vercel builds successfully without timeout or script errors

## Vercel Deployment Configuration

The deployment is configured with the following settings:

- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Node.js Version: 18.x
- Environment Variables: All required keys from `.env.local`

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, the following should be verified:

1. Image upload and OCR text extraction works correctly
2. Analysis results display nutritional information accurately
3. Firebase meal saving functions correctly
4. Error handling gracefully recovers from potential issues
5. Performance is acceptable with the new OCR approach
