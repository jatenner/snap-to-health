# Environment Variables Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. OpenAI API Key and Model Access

**Problem:** Getting `401` errors from OpenAI with "Incorrect API key" despite having set `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The primary issue was that `gpt-4-vision-preview` model has been deprecated.

**Solution:**
- Updated code to use `gpt-4o` model instead of the deprecated `gpt-4-vision-preview`
- Validated that the API key format is correct (should be `sk-proj-*` for GPT-4 and vision models)
- Added better error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Created diagnostic scripts to verify key validity and model access

### 2. Firebase Admin Private Key

**Problem:** Vercel logs showing "Decoded private key is not in valid PEM format" despite having the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` set.

**Solution:**
- Created a script to properly encode the Firebase private key from service account JSON
- Added validation of the decoded key format to ensure it has proper PEM headers, footers, and newlines
- Provided tools to automatically update the `.env.local.firebase` file with the correct value
- Implemented better error logging in the Firebase Admin initialization

## New Tools Added

1. **verify-env-keys.js**: Comprehensive verification script that tests both OpenAI and Firebase keys
   - Validates API key formats
   - Tests actual API access to both services
   - Provides clear feedback and recommendations

2. **test-gpt4-vision.js**: Specifically tests OpenAI vision model access
   - Checks if the deprecated `gpt-4-vision-preview` or new `gpt-4o` models are accessible
   - Makes a test API call with a mock image
   - Reports which models are available to your API key

3. **encode-firebase-key.js**: Properly encodes Firebase service account private keys 
   - Reads the service account JSON file
   - Validates the private key format
   - Base64 encodes the key correctly
   - Updates `.env.local.firebase` automatically

## Code Changes

1. Updated `analyzeImageWithGPT4V.ts`:
   - Changed model from `gpt-4-vision-preview` to `gpt-4o`
   - Improved error handling for model access issues
   - Enhanced detection of deprecated models
   - Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to GPT-3.5 if needed

2. Updated TypeScript types:
   - Fixed the return type of `validateGptAnalysisResult` to be `boolean` instead of an object with `.valid` property
   - Ensured all code paths properly handle the new return type

## Next Steps

1. **Vercel Environment Variables**: Update the Vercel project settings:
   - Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to the `sk-proj-*` API key
   - Update `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` with the correctly encoded value from `encode-firebase-key.js`

2. **Trigger Deployment**: After updating environment variables:
   - Trigger a new deployment on Vercel to apply the changes
   - Monitor the deployment logs for any remaining issues

3. **Testing**: Verify the fix by:
   - Testing image analysis functionality
   - Checking for proper fallback to GPT-3.5 if needed
   - Verifying Firebase uploads are working
   - Confirming no console errors for PEM format, OpenAI key, or missing props
