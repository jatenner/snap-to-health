# OCR Text-Based Analysis Implementation

## Overview

This update completely removes GPT-4 Vision dependencies and replaces them with a text-based OCR analysis pipeline. The new approach:

1. Uses Tesseract.js for OCR text extraction from uploaded meal images
2. Analyzes the extracted text using GPT-4o for meal component identification 
3. Retrieves nutritional data from Nutritionix API based on identified food items
4. Generates personalized feedback based on health goals and dietary preferences

## Key Changes

- **Removed Vision Dependencies**: All references to `gpt-4-vision-preview` have been removed
- **OCR Implementation**: Added serverless-compatible OCR that works reliably in Vercel's environment
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Created robust fallback mechanisms for OCR errors 
- **Performance Optimization**: Added timeout handling and improved response times
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting and recovery mechanisms

## Environment Configuration

The system now uses the following environment settings:

```
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxx
OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS=30000

# OCR Configuration  
USE_OCR_EXTRACTION=true
OCR_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7

# Vision Configuration
USE_GPT4_VISION=false
```

## Deployment Notes

The application has been optimized for Vercel deployment with several key improvements:

1. Configured webpack to handle Tesseract.js worker scripts
2. Added Vercel environment detection for optimal OCR handling
3. Fixed Firebase initialization for serverless functions
4. Improved build process to eliminate timeout issues

## Testing

Before deploying, verify:

1. Image upload and analysis works with text-based OCR
2. Firebase meal saving functions correctly
3. Analysis display shows correct nutrition data and recommendations
4. Error handling gracefully recovers from potential issues
