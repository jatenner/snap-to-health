# Firebase Admin SDK Fixes

## Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive fix for Firebase Admin SDK initialization issues, focusing on proper private key handling through base64 encoding. These changes ensure that Firebase Admin works reliably across all environments, especially in production on Vercel.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Private Key Format**: Solved issues with newlines and special characters in the private key by using base64 encoding
2. **Environment Variable Handling**: Standardized on `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` and removed legacy `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
3. **Validation Logic**: Enhanced validation to ensure proper PEM format and newlines in the decoded key
4. **Improved Diagnostics**: Added detailed logging and a diagnostic endpoint for troubleshooting

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `firebaseAdmin.ts`

- Added detailed logging of private key decoding process
- Improved validation of decoded key format
- Added informative error messages for troubleshooting

### 2. Created New Helper Scripts

- `convertServiceAccountToEnv.js`: Converts service account JSON to base64-encoded environment variables
- `vercel-env-check.js`: Checks and updates Vercel environment variables
- `testFirebaseAdmin.js`: Tests Firebase Admin initialization and connectivity

### 3. Added Diagnostic Endpoint

- Created `/api/debug/firebase-check` for verifying Firebase Admin configuration
- Protected with authorization in production environments

### 4. Updated Environment Variables

- Removed any references to `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Updated `.env.local.example` to use base64 encoding
- Cleaned up duplicate entries in `.env.local`

### 5. Added Documentation

- Created `docs/FIREBASE_ADMIN.md` with detailed setup instructions
- Added `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive Firebase setup
- Updated README with Firebase configuration guidelines

## Verification Steps

The following steps were taken to verify the fixes:

1. Ran `testFirebaseAdmin.js` to verify base64 key decoding and Firebase connectivity
2. Started the development server and tested the diagnostic endpoint
3. Verified all validation checks pass:
   - Base64 key present and has correct length (2272 characters)
   - Decoded key contains proper PEM headers
   - Key has expected number of newlines (28)
   - Firebase Admin initializes successfully
   - Firestore connection works

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy these changes:

1. Run `./deploy-firebase-fix.sh` which will:
   - Check and update Vercel environment variables
   - Build the project
   - Deploy to production

2. After deployment, verify Firebase Admin initialization by:
   - Checking production logs
   - Calling the diagnostic endpoint with proper authorization

## Additional Notes

- We've completely eliminated the need for escaping newlines in private keys
- The base64 approach provides better cross-platform compatibility
- This fix resolves issues with Vercel's environment variable handling
- All Firebase Admin SDK functionality should now work reliably in production
