# Firebase Configuration Sync Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Firebase configuration synchronization process that was performed to ensure proper authentication and analytics functionality for the SnapHealth application.

## Actions Completed

1. **Verified Firebase Configuration**
   - Checked all Firebase environment variables in `.env.local`
   - Confirmed that the API key and other required variables are present
   - Verified that all variables are properly formatted

2. **Synchronized Configuration Files**
   - Checked for consistency between `.env.local` and `.env.local.firebase`
   - Confirmed that all Firebase variables match between the two files
   - No discrepancies found in Firebase configuration

3. **Updated Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Removed and re-added all Firebase environment variables to Vercel
   - Successfully updated the following variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`
     - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
     - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID`
     - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`

4. **Redeployed Application**
   - Initiated a new production deployment with updated environment variables
   - Deployment will use the correct Firebase configuration for authentication and analytics

## Configuration Status

✅ **All Firebase variables are present and valid**
✅ **Configuration is consistent across all environments**
✅ **Firebase authentication should work correctly**

## Used Scripts

Several scripts were created to facilitate this process:

1. `scripts/verify-firebase-config-match.js` - Verifies Firebase configuration in `.env.local` and `.env.local.firebase`
2. `scripts/update-all-firebase-vars.js` - Updates all Firebase variables in Vercel
3. `scripts/check-firebase-api-key.js` - Specifically checks and updates the Firebase API key

## Next Steps

- Monitor the application to confirm that Firebase authentication is working properly
- Verify that analytics data is being collected correctly
- If any issues persist, check the Firebase console for error messages
